Vim Cursor
================

This is an example keyboard to demonstrate the power of
layers and advanced key codes. The behaviour is simple:

- By default, keys act as expected.
- When the space bar is held, keys ``HJKL`` are remapped
  to move the cursor left, down, up, and right. The remapping
  is disabled when the space bar is released.
